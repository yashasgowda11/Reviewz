## Introduction

Our team project, "Reviewz," aims to revolutionize the movie rating experience by offering a platform where the gap between critic and viewer insights is bridged. Through comprehensive user research, brainstorming, and iterative prototyping, we identified the need for a simplified user interface and a balanced review system. Our proposal introduces a single-page application to streamline the process of submitting and finding reviews, emphasizing intuitive navigation, and reducing on-screen clutter. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to presenting movie ratings: combining critic and viewer scores into one cohesive percentage while still allowing users to delve into specific ratings by category. This ensures a balanced perspective, enabling users to make informed decisions based on a comprehensive understanding of a movie's reception. Through usability testing, we refined our concepts to ensure they cater to the needs and preferences of a diverse audience, prioritizing ease of use, spoiler prevention, and equitable representation of opinions in the cinematic community.

## User Research Summary

The user research conducted by the team involved interviews with a mix of movie critics, content creators, and general viewers to gather insights on UI improvements for movie review websites. The goal was to identify areas where the user interface could be made more intuitive and user-friendly, emphasizing the importance of balancing critic and viewer reviews, enhancing personalization, and improving accessibility. Participants expressed a desire for a streamlined review submission process, a cleaner interface with fewer ads, better management of spoiler content, and a more responsive and user-friendly mobile site. The feedback underscored the need for a platform that values both professional critiques and viewer opinions equally, suggesting enhancements like direct communication tools for community engagement and advanced search options to cater to specific user preferences. These insights informed "how might we" statements, focusing on creating a more engaging, balanced, and user-centric movie rating experience. 

## Storyboard


#### 1. Simple Task: View the Overall Rating for a Movie 

The image depicts a hand-drawn comic strip with nine panels, each illustrating a different scene. It appears to revolve around two characters discussing movie reviews. The first character expresses a dislike for a movie, prompting the second character to ask for their phone to presumably write a review. Subsequent panels show the process of writing and submitting a review, checking review statistics, and receiving thanks for contributing. The overall tone is light-hearted, with the characters engaging in playful banter about the influence of reviews.

#### 2. Medium Task: View the Rating Breakdown for a Movie 

The second image presents another comic strip, titled "Medium Task: View the Rating Breakdown for a Movie." It features characters discussing the functionality of a review website, specifically focusing on the rating breakdown of a movie. One character shows another how to access detailed ratings, while the latter expresses delight in learning how to view the breakdown. The strip humorously addresses the process of navigating review statistics and the value of understanding diverse opinions, as well as the appreciation for the website's features.

#### 3. Complex Task: View Individual Ratings within Either the Critics or Viewers Category 

The third image illustrates a comic strip titled "Complex Task: View Individual Ratings within Either the Critics or Viewers Category." It portrays a character learning to navigate a website to view detailed individual ratings from critics or viewers for a movie. The character is shown following steps to filter and view the ratings, experiencing satisfaction upon learning how to access this level of detail. The comic ends on a positive note with the character appreciating the website's comprehensive review system and considering it good enough to recommend in an app store review.
