## Introduction

Our team project, "Reviewz," aims to revolutionize the movie rating experience by offering a platform where the gap between critic and viewer insights is bridged. Through comprehensive user research, brainstorming, and iterative prototyping, we identified the need for a simplified user interface and a balanced review system. Our proposal introduces a single-page application to streamline the process of submitting and finding reviews, emphasizing intuitive navigation, and reducing on-screen clutter. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to presenting movie ratings: combining critic and viewer scores into one cohesive percentage while still allowing users to delve into specific ratings by category. This ensures a balanced perspective, enabling users to make informed decisions based on a comprehensive understanding of a movie's reception. Through usability testing, we refined our concepts to ensure they cater to the needs and preferences of a diverse audience, prioritizing ease of use, spoiler prevention, and equitable representation of opinions in the cinematic community.

## Target Audience

The target audience for "Reviewz" includes a broad range of movie-goers, from casual viewers who occasionally watch movies to avid cinema enthusiasts who frequently read and write reviews. The platform is designed to cater to users of varying tech-savviness, ensuring accessibility and ease of use for everyone. Special consideration is given to ensuring that the interface is intuitive enough for users who may not be as familiar with digital movie platforms.


## User Research Summary

The user research conducted by the team involved interviews with a mix of movie critics, content creators, and general viewers to gather insights on UI improvements for movie review websites. The goal was to identify areas where the user interface could be made more intuitive and user-friendly, emphasizing the importance of balancing critic and viewer reviews, enhancing personalization, and improving accessibility. Participants expressed a desire for a streamlined review submission process, a cleaner interface with fewer ads, better management of spoiler content, and a more responsive and user-friendly mobile site. The feedback underscored the need for a platform that values both professional critiques and viewer opinions equally, suggesting enhancements like direct communication tools for community engagement and advanced search options to cater to specific user preferences. These insights informed "how might we" statements, focusing on creating a more engaging, balanced, and user-centric movie rating experience. 

## Lo-fi Prototypes

Reviewz elevates the movie rating experience by harmonizing critic insights and viewer opinions on a single platform, promoting a balanced review ecosystem. This project began with extensive brainstorming and led to the development of two key ideas: simplifying the user interface for streamlined review submissions and creating a balanced review platform where both critic and viewer ratings are equally emphasized. The lo-fi prototypes helped us understand user interactions and refine the UI. User testing with critics and viewers alike confirmed the usability and appeal of our design. Our approach differentiates from platforms like IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes by integrating both perspectives into one comprehensive rating, making it easier for users to get a quick understanding of a movie's reception.

## Mid-fi Prototype

Reviewz streamlines the user journey from simple tasks like viewing overall movie ratings on the homepage to more complex tasks such as detailed graphical analysis of individual critic and viewer ratings. Our mid-fi prototype enhances navigation with onboarding pages, a prominent home button, and direct links to personal review sections. We've introduced a visually compelling design using a black background for elegance, gold for highlighting important ratings, and red to indicate spoilers, ensuring clarity and a sophisticated user interface. The prototype currently supports detailed interactions for a single movie, with plans to expand this functionality.

## Heuristic Analysis Summary 

In response to the feedback, significant enhancements were made to the Mid-Fi prototype to address the identified issues:
 
**_Standardised Design Elements:_** The sizes of all sign-in buttons were standardised, and a consistent design language was applied across all interactive elements to create a cohesive look and feel.

**_Clarified Numerical Representations:_** The design was updated to include clear labels and tooltips for numbers in the rating section, ensuring users understand what each number represents without confusion.

**_Enhanced Interactivity:_** Interactive elements such as rating breakdowns were made more prominent with visual cues like hover effects and subtle animations to indicate that they can be interacted with.

**_Improved Text Readability:_** The font size across the platform was increased to a minimum of 12 points to ensure that all text is easily readable, including movie titles and review content.

**_Optimised Image Use:_** Efforts were made to source higher-quality images that fit the required dimensions without losing important visual information such as movie titles.
