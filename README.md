## Introduction

Our team project, "Reviewz," aims to revolutionize the movie rating experience by offering a platform where the gap between critic and viewer insights is bridged. Through comprehensive user research, brainstorming, and iterative prototyping, we identified the need for a simplified user interface and a balanced review system. Our proposal introduces a single-page application to streamline the process of submitting and finding reviews, emphasizing intuitive navigation, and reducing on-screen clutter. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to presenting movie ratings: combining critic and viewer scores into one cohesive percentage while still allowing users to delve into specific ratings by category. This ensures a balanced perspective, enabling users to make informed decisions based on a comprehensive understanding of a movie's reception. Through usability testing, we refined our concepts to ensure they cater to the needs and preferences of a diverse audience, prioritizing ease of use, spoiler prevention, and equitable representation of opinions in the cinematic community.

## User Research Summary

The user research conducted by the team involved interviews with a mix of movie critics, content creators, and general viewers to gather insights on UI improvements for movie review websites. The goal was to identify areas where the user interface could be made more intuitive and user-friendly, emphasizing the importance of balancing critic and viewer reviews, enhancing personalization, and improving accessibility. Participants expressed a desire for a streamlined review submission process, a cleaner interface with fewer ads, better management of spoiler content, and a more responsive and user-friendly mobile site. The feedback underscored the need for a platform that values both professional critiques and viewer opinions equally, suggesting enhancements like direct communication tools for community engagement and advanced search options to cater to specific user preferences. These insights informed "how might we" statements, focusing on creating a more engaging, balanced, and user-centric movie rating experience.
